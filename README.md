# Snake Game

**Snake Game** is a classic implementation of the Snake game using JavaFX. This simple and intuitive game allows players to control a snake, eat food to grow, and avoid collisions with walls and itself. It features basic controls, including arrow keys for movement, spacebar for pause/resume, and a restart button. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the snake consumes food.
